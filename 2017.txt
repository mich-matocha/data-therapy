The conversation I’m referring to was very two-way, i.e. we were basically talking to, confiding in and supporting one another, the combination of which of significantly decreased what normally would have been either, a much more difficult conversation or simply, would not hav4 been taking place

I went to my direct manager to get consistent time off during the day to go to therapy. He was supportive, but would get uncomfortable when talking about mental illness.

had a depression episode and sought help for support (counseling, work schedule adjustments, etc).  The staff were supportive, respectful, and had lots of resources available.  Was able to see a counselor same day, and establish ongoing support quickly.
-1
My supervisor was outwardly understanding at first but the situation eventually became discriminatory in nature
A few days after my father died, my boss told me to "compartmentalize" and just get back to work. In the previous six months, I had lost 3 other close relatives and had a miscarriage. I was demented with depression and never took the time off I needed. It's been 3 years and I'm just getting out of the hole. 
-1
-1
At my previous place of employment I had a mental illness that manifested itself physically and was very obvious to anyone who saw me. One of my supervisors brought up that he had a family member who suffered from the same way, and he seemed pretty understanding and was easy to talk to
-1
Had a bad panic attack in a meeting, had to tell my supervisor why I was leaving.
-1
-1
I made them aware of my past issues with mental health and its effects. I was shortly thereafter released from work due to "other issues" despite proficiency at my duties.
-1
-1
A supervisor at one of my previous jobs suffered from anxiety disorder so any discussion about such was generally well received and I was supported. But only that one person in that one job.
-1
-1
Discussed with a manager I knew well and trusted. I would not if that hadn't been the case. It was more just notification that I would have appointments during the day.

I mentioned a period of depression (and having clinical depression) and was lauded for being so transparent and willing to be so vulnerable. I was given PTO and other support during that time.

I asked for a couple days off when I was feeling very depressed. My supervisor was very accommodating.

It really doesn't end well unless you roll a natural 20.
I've disclosed my mental health state many times as a result of its impact affecting me negatively. The response has been mixed. By superiors who knew me directly, the response was positive; by the company at large and human resources, the response was negative, as if I had suddenly become a "burden" to the company, and as if there was now an impetus on the company to find an engineer with my skillset but without my mental illness.

My work output and attitude towards work was slacking so she pulled me aside to discuss it with me and I told her I was suffering with depression.

I discussed my clinical depression and anxiety with a manager who put a lot of pressure on me to produce. I regret sharing that information with him, as he used it as a lever against me.

they were aware of issues, but not the specifics. it was held against me, i believe
They noticed I was more withdrawn, so I told them I've been having a rough time and I started counseling. I don't remember their response.

I talked about my anxiety and depression. At first, the issue was exacerbated because the trigger was work. After outside intervention, I went to therapy more often and then things got better. I think my supervisor also told the owner of the company. She was very understanding.

Talked to direct manager about challenges. Received encouragement to do what I needed and take the time I needed to address my problems.
-1

Generally I was able to identify when my work was suffering and I could take "Mental Health days", and I was able to negotiate my hours down to manageable levels if needed. Sometimes doing so even at hiring interview time.

Years ago, after a messy breakup I was on a rather short fuse for a while.  A few months afterward my CEO told me I should have brought it up to them so they could have helped reduce my stress levels at work.  By that point it had passed so no further action was taken.
I told about being bullied at school and negative consequences of it, including hospitalization. No valueable advices were given, not even that he was a psychologist. Simply ignoring the problem.

I made my manger aware as I felt it was impacting my performance, seemed ok until slary review 9 months later where I was penalised for not performing, no pay rise and questioned about my ability after working there 15 years

I told one of my bosses that I'm clinically depressed and I see a therapist on the regular, and that I'm trying out prescriptions to see what works. They were OK with it but didn't like what the meds did to me (akathisia, giddiness) and said I was being unprofessional even though I had no idea what the effects would be either, and no control over how my body responded except whether or not to continue medicating.

I mentioned that I was going to therapy to deal with my mental health issues, they did not question me about this but indicated that they see this as a useful way of dealing with problems

Due to deadline pressure and off-hours outage response I was having difficulty sleeping. My manager decided that this was a bridge too far and took over outage responses to reduce my stress level.
-1

I was depressed about getting on the bad side of my 2nd level manager and the more upset I was with him the more he was with me and the less work I got done. I got into trouble for being "too involved" with another company because I signed an NDA and didn't realize I couldn't sign it as a personal thing. Ended up crying with my direct manager. And he was trying to be helpful and figure out what to do.

In 4 instances I disclosed to my employer my mental health issues. 3 were for information purposes. 1 was defensive. One boss became uncomfortable. One was familiar with my issues. One was accepting and helpful. The defensive sharing was (I had hoped) to prevent being fired. I was told I didn't provide the right kind of information and was still fired (for performance directly affected by my mental illness).

They gave advice...that's it
I needed to talk to my supervisor regarding my need to see a therapist because I could not schedule therapy sessions outside of work hours.

My supervisor was supportive and allowed me to do whatever I needed. I believe my anonymity was protected, however the rest of the office clearly judged and placed pressure on me for leaving and returning after taking a lunch break.

I joked that I was the best candidate for the job because I have crippling OCD and that makes me a good programmer. I was then hired.
-1
Stressed and job not right fit. I let them know I was leaving for a better fit.
-1
-1
-1

It was very HR related to discuss timing. It was rather dry, and mostly focused around whether or not it was burn out and if I needed minimal time off to recover.

request to leave early once a week for therapy was met with expectations of working more another day to make up for missed time
I had to take a leave of absence due to a serious mental health episode related to the stress of my job, my employer reacted admirably in that they let me take leave, but didn't say anything beyond that. The feeling was that I was leaving them hanging.
-1
With prior employers, it has always signified the 'beginning of the end' for working there. It - to me - feels as though after disclosure that I was pushed out of the organizations.

I've been fired from two companies after disclosing that I suffer with PTSD and its related symptoms such as depression and anxiety. I asked for help. They helped me to the door.
-1
I told them how my ADD affected my work, the challenges it presented, the things I'm working on to cope better.
-1
I had an anxiety attack at work, and needed to explain that these could happen infrequently. They were concerned that I could complete my daily duties, and asked if I needed to take time at home. They were also mindful of how I performed at work.

During a bout of severe depression, I told my direct manager that I felt my performance was suffering and the job was causing me undue stress.

A very long and difficult depression episode led to me dropping down to 50% time for a few months while I worked my way through it
-1

I informed my supervisor that I was depressed, and seeking treatment. I was ignored and ultimately ostracized.

It was a mostly one-sided conversation. I explained why my mood and work outlook was the way that it was recently. No action on their part was taken or really needed to be taken.
-1
-1
I approached them about potential reasonable accommodation(s) and compromises re: health as well as solutions that could work for each side while not affecting overall company or productivity. They declined all suggestions brought to the table and suggested that I take better care of myself outside of work as it wasn't their responsibility.

The previous VP Engineering was himself familiar with mental health issues and was open and understanding. I brought up my anxiety and he did what he could to help, including arranging a space for me at work that would eliminate distractions and interruptions.

It was a huge mistake to ever mention my mental health with my supervisors. (This was as a graduate student in materials science.) I was immediately treated differently and with suspicion, subjected to unfair treatment intended to ‘help’ me that made matters much worse, was pressured into letting my supervisors contact my therapist and psychiatrist and ask questions about me, and then fired after my supervisors totally misinterpreted the answers they received. Even the HR department at the university was surprised by how badly they handled it.

That i was struggling. He recommended resources that helped
See above. It's pretty generically the response. Of course I tend to downplay, say "anxiety" and not PTSD. 
-1
I was under treatment for PTSD last year (at previous employer), and I told my manager and team leads and HR that I was vulnerable and needed to put some measures in place to ensure my safety (my abusers knew where I worked and I was afraid they might come after me). My colleagues were very understanding and supportive of my safety and recovery.

I was in a sort of a anxiety period and I was worried about my behaviour in the team. The employer was somehow surprised about the conversation and expressed his sympathy and that was that. Afterwords I wished I've never mentioned it.

Most people in my previous company worked remotely, which has pros and cons for certain kinds of mental health issues.  We'd have somewhat open conversations about the fact that it was a unique issue for our company, but I don't think any tailored program was ever created.
-1
-1
Mentioned my burnout and depression. It came up later as the reason for my departure, which it wasn't. Left due to too many assholes in the team.

Had a major stress/depression breakdown and spoke to my supervisor about the treatment needed and the time that I was going to need to do the treatment. At the moment was that could either work or I could get fired but if I haven't had that talk I wouldn't know. That treatment was key for me to keep moving forward on the tech industry and, as far as I know, my confidentially was kept but I think that was major because of my supervisor.

I brought up issues that were related both to physical and mental health (depression following a surgical procedure) and ended up getting fired about a month later for performance issues.... after a stellar performance review and 10% raise (which was when I disclosed the depression).

The conversation I described in (current employer section) was actually supposed to be here. It was about my previous employer.

Depression/anxiety (related to diagnosed ADD) was exacerbated by a major physical injury caused some attendance issues with one employer. The conversation was not well received, or responded to. The general feeling was "try harder"/"you're not trying hard enough". 
-1
-1

i asked for days off to deal with anxiety and ptsd. the first time it always seemed fine but by the second time the response would usually chill.

I actually worked for a family owned company, so I discussed my mental health with my uncle, who was my boss, as well as my coworker who was my supervisor. Sometimes I'd need to flex my time to see my therapist, and that was understood. Although, when missing work and saying I'd need a personal day, it was questioned and not taken at face value.
