You are depressed: take vacation. You feel weird: admit it is physical (otherwise it is not serious) go and see a doctor (and if you are on sick leave too many days you will get fired). You don't feel good today: take a holiday but don't work from home. 

In startup there is what I call the tyranny of happiness: you have to look happy to be accepted and to be worked with. At some point playing a role can definitely make the mental health issue worse and it is also a threat to diversity :(

I don't like to call mental health issues an issue but actually when it comes to company field it too often becomes an issue and this is sad because working is sometimes better than medication. It is a vicious circle: people are scared of speaking about it so they don't inform their coworkers about what mental health is for real and so coworkers are so scared on a regular basis that the people with mental health ""issues"" keep it for themselves.

Likewise, I worry I'm seen as less-than by my employer in some circumstances. Regerdless, I don't regret being public and raising awareness.

This usage of a different schedule for UCR and often the lower rate is very hard to determine before purchasing insurance even in the new health insurance exchanges.

I had been struggling for 3 months prior to disclosure and was incredibly relieved when finally diagnosed. Growing up in a family open about mental health and also at the end of my rope, I immediately shared with management what was going on. I requested a temporary reduced workload so I could reduce anxiety. (At time I didn't know it was anxiety as took me a year to accept that the (to me) ""deserved"" stress was anxiety, caused by my core diagnosis.) When disclosing, I didn't deeply understand details of the state of my mental health; I simply knew I was so stressed out by having been unable to get myself to do work in three months that I couldn't juggle all that was currently on my plate.

It was at this point my direct manager and I began an almost daily struggle. After working on a single project and making progress (compared to 3 months before diagnosis when management didn't even know how bad I was doing), I requested increasing my workload. This was never granted; boss said I hadn't proved myself and implied I could not be trusted.

Two huge issues stick out to me from that experience:
1) Company assumes things would be better and back to 100% within months. They did not understand what one goes through when figuring out meds: things at times got worse. They did not understand how long it takes until meds are figured out: mine took two years. They most certainly would not truly understand why to this day, four years later, despite being ""stable"" I'm in counseling every other week in addition to being on meds. Rather than supporting that, it would be seen as ""oh, I'm sorry"". I was a problem to my manager because he didn't see improvements each week.
2) Accomodations.
- There was no option for me to reduce work temporarily to part-time (too complicated). Instead, they pushed me to take disability leave. I told them that wouldn't help; they told me to double-check with care providers. That required me to see a psychologist unnecessarily, as psychologist said I didn't qualify for leave. (Expensive, unnecessary appointment).
- The assistance I needed the most at work was understanding: I was open, but my manager told me to not tell my co-worker assigned to support me. That was disasterous for colleague's stress/frustration levels. He knew something was up, but was barred from asking and I was implied it was better to keep my mouth shut.
- Accommodations weren't understood by even Benefits, as they're not trained in mental health nor do they have people come in to assess how they're doing in supporting those with mental health issues. Should be no different than people coming in to assess for physical accessibility of the workplace. When in a meeting with my manager supervised by HR, I shouldn't feel like I'm asking too much of manager when requesting he put the negative critiques on the back burner and help me figure out whether I'm doing anything right. That this didn't stop him from coming into my office that same day and ""putting on my dick hat"" to yell at me for something that wasn't even my fault (he had brought in co-worker for this yelling, and turned to finish yelling at this person): FUCKING UNACCEPTABLE.

While I will never return to that company and as such took the severance package, I will NEVER agree with their legal reason for being unable to do the job: me being ""medically disqualified from this role"". I was too expensive in the short term for them; I'm not worth the cost."

In general I'm not telling anyway unless it really matters and it would be a gain in some way or the other. Not because I don't trust the community members close to me but because I don't want to be that guy. And IMHO it doesn't and shouldn't matter but sadly some people are funky about that.

I worked too much, had too much pressure on myself from being the sole developer on a delayed project that seemed to grow in size with each week it was delayed by and worried about money a lot.

I became depressed and anxious and had trouble eating, sleeping and generally being myself. As my depression worsened I was regularly late for work, couldn't perform as well as I should and became irritable with my colleagues.

My employers response, after a while, was to send me private messages complaining about my lateness which only worsened the situation. I was prescribed 3 weeks off work by my doctor, which my employer agreed to, only to come back after to find I had been on 'statutory pay' which was roughly half of what I was expecting and was not enough to cover my rent, bills AND food. This made me worse and sent me into another depression until I eventually admitted defeat, gave up working and left the company. It took me months to recover and I'm now left (over 6 months after this all started) recovering from the fallout I created leaving employment with hardly any money to my name.

I had previously been told by my employer that I ""was too young to burn out"" and (stupidly) trusted them. I did not feel comfortable discussing my problems with my employer because each time I was met with an attitude that I had to ""get myself together"" and ultimately, given the amount of employees before me who had left the company by being fired after an altercation with the employer, left me with no option but to hide it from them so I too wouldn't be fired."
