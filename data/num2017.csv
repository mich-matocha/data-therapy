To be very general my experiences are that the larger/older companies who in the past did not emphasize employee mental health as part of their company values have harder time supporting mental health than smaller/newer companies. The idea that mental health and work life balance should be protected and encouraged by employers is a relatively new thing (at least it seems that way to me).  I feel like the smaller or newer the company the easier it is to create the infrastructure to support employee mental health.,For context I have worked for 3 different tech companies. 2 of them were companies that could be labeled as being more traditionally corporate and my current employer began as a startup and has only in the past 3 or 4 years grown into a larger/stable company.
