I discussed my mental health with my previous company (Applied Predictive Technologies) and they used it against me. Any time I needed to go home early due to sickness, HR would ask if it was physical or mental. When I eventually took time off for my mental health, they kept prying about it, and I did not feel comfortable there anymore. They did not care if I had mental health issues and needed time off- they would consistently tell me to work from home or communicate with them what was going on with me. I did not want to disclose this information with anyone, since the HR Manager at my branch would not keep information confidential, and it was eventually known to other employees in the company that I was out due to mental illness, even though I did not tell anyone except HR (which is NECESSARY when going on leave!) I had no choice but to put in my two weeks shortly after I came back, to which they told me to pack up and leave. I was not respected at APT, and I would like for someone to look into this, if possible. I tried to report them, but my mental health issues were so bad, I could not handle the stress that reporting them would give me.
I was going through a tough breakup and I shared that in my 1 to 1 meeting with my manager. He was very understanding and offered to pass on the message to the other team members so I didn't have to. He also said it was okay if I wanted to take an afternoon off. Later that day I received a lot of warm supportive message from my coworkers.

As I was going through a difficult time, I asked my manager above all to not treat me differently nor attribute my actions at work to stuff going on outside of work.
I was diagnosed with PTSD during a time when my supervisor was under investigation for embezzling and I had access to some of the paper trail. He retaliated. I worked with his superiors, who were very supportive.

At a previous job at a startup, I attempted to inform both my manager and the CEO about my MH problems. The CEO told me not to worry about it because "we're all family" and "your health is the most important thing." The manager just stared at me. Two days after my conversation with the CEO, I was "laid off" and lost all medical and MH benefits.

Once I quit a job because of stress and relationship strain, having that conversation was pretty easy with the manager and not so easy with the CEO. Another company, during a divorce with my first wife, I became quite depressed and it was starting to impact my performance, attendance, etc. The manager of that company sat me down and asked how he could personally help.

My previous employer was much more understanding and accepting of mental illness, as they were bipolar themselves. 
Once i chose to confide in a manager about my battle with major depression and recovery from addiction/alcoholism. They later threw it in my face when I decided to quit and used my past honesty to insult me.

At a previous company, I had a co-worker who was a bully to me and who would berate me and undermine me in all of our meetings. I had brought this up both to the co-worker and to my manager, but my manager dismissed it because my co-worker was a woman. I brought the issue up to HR and they told me that the company will pay for up to 3 sessions with a counselor if I felt I needed it. I did use the 3 sessions, but I later found out that my manager had told my team that I had started going to therapy. I left the company shortly afterwards.

I was working in a glass factory (working swing shift) when I was dealing with symptoms of bipolar disorder. The nurse kept everything confidential and provided me resources to get the help I needed including time off from work as needed.

Was always very positive because they had similar issues. Would allow me to take time for myself if needed.
It was a very open and honest conversation and my direct supervisor had similar issues and concerns. Overall it was very much accommodating and accepting, though I would still say there was a lack of in office resources to deal with it other than just time off from work or working from home when needed.

After my boyfriend died, I had to discuss accommodations I would need to return to work while dealing with difficulty concentrating, flashbacks of time in the hospital, and stress level. They seemed uncomfortable but were accommodating and said I could do whatever was needed. They were very good about allowing me time off after his death, up to a point. Then hints were made that I should be returning to work (about 2 weeks after he entered the hospital, 1 week after his death). I returned to work 1 1/2 weeks after his death. I was definitely not ready, but didn't know how to broach the topic.
I gave my former boss a medical note that said I couldn’t work more than 40 hours a week and she was shocked and questioned that I was even working more than 40 hours a week and said she would share it with her boss.

When I worked at DigitalOcean, I informed them I wasn't doing well mentally. They noticed it too, that I wasn't the same. I told them I was seeking help and finding a therapist. They said they were there to support me. After being assessed and tested, the psychiatrist confirmed I had ADHD, causing impulsive outbursts and irritability, particularly under high stress. I was fired within 2 weeks after working there for 3 years with 3 raises and promotions. When they said why I was let go, it was because "the psychiatrist didn't come back with an illness for your behavior." They didn't take my mental health, my mental illness seriously.

I was dealing with a poor work environment and a lot of microaggressions/overt sexism and ableism from the C level of the startup I was at. It was making my PTSD worse. I went to HR but she couldn't do anything. She was mostly concerned I might sue over things that had happened. I ended up leaving on disability before I quit completely.

I was asking for understanding as I needed to leave work at odd hours to attend therapy. They (CEO, CTO, COO) were opem and empathetic, and shared their own stories of counselling and looking after their own mental health.
I suffered from depression after the death of my mother. My employer offered me time off to deal with the problem, and lightened my workload accordingly.
