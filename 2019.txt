nothing notable.  Often don't know how to react.

Same as above
I told my previous supervisor that I would be attending therapy appts during the workday regarding grief. He was supportive and said I didn't need to disclose anything unneeded and had no issues with me taking the time to attend appts.
When I left my previous job I mentioned my self-diagnosed burnout.

As simple as it could be I was direct and, at that moment I was ok, if I was fired, and said that I needed therapy and probably treatment for my stress level. He was ok with (as even if it wasn't ok, he didn't have an option) and from the therapist, I was directed to a doctor and got treated. A solid great decision that helped me extremely.

I was able to easily arrange a four-day work week with my supervisor to work on improving my mental and physical health.
It went horribly. I was a PhD student and disclosed to my supervisors that I was suffering from depression and anxiety but was seeing a therapist and taking steps to feel better. (This was partly related to the poor progress of my project, and their supervision style.) They said they understood but treated me with a very kid-gloves approach for a few weeks, then demanded to ask mu therapist questions about me. Eventually I agreed to let them send their questions to an HR person, who would act as an intermediary between them and the therapist. They wanted to know if I was a danger to myself or others. The therapist replied that I was not. My supervisors then told me that the therapist’s answer showed that my illness was no excuse for the poor state of my project. They put me on a ten-week ‘improvement plan’ that was logically impossible to succeed at, and then pushed me out of the PhD studentship.

Discussed substance abuse relapse and was able to set up treatment
They knew I was having issues and when I started taking medication. When they became a larger company no one cared anymore and let me go.

I expressed concerns about my anxiety/panic attacks and how they were impacting my work.  My employer assured me that my work was meeting expectations and encouraged me to adjust my work schedule or routine as needed to ensure I was able to complete my work while also maintaining my mental health.

I disclosed my mental illnesses to a previous supervisor, and he actually then disclosed that he shared the same illnesses. I didn't feel so alone after that conversation.

I've had to take time off for mental health (usually about 4 weeks) a few times in my career. I usually have to hit the breaking point before changes are made to my workload or anxiety-producing situation. I have also resigned due to mental health (and in one case, returned later).

The one I can think of is now one of my co-founders who also has mental health issues so it wasn't a difficult conversation.
was not good
"I am about to tip over into a depression, Theo." "We've got your back covered. Go, take therapy and do everything you need to do; in the mean time your job is here for you."
I was suffering from fairly serious burnout at a previous company and asked for a lighter workload as well as time off in order to recover in February. It was ignored for several months until I was at a point where I was largely unable to perform my work duties.

I approached a former boss (who still worked at the company) in April who gave me advice on ways to delegate my work and allow myself some time to recover. My current manager felt like I had gone behind their back when in fact I had approached them first. 

In July, things reached a breaking point and I approached my previous manager for advice on how to ask for significant time off for medical reasons. They went with me to my current manager and I received 2.5 weeks off with the promise of more if I needed it.

2 weeks in I asked for additional time off and was instead called into a meeting where I was let go due to performance issues.

Expressed concern that I was struggling. Supervisor retaliated by saying that they didn't know if they would be comfortable letting me travel out of country for a summer fellowship.

Empathy. Flexibility.

I told my advisor I was under going a very bad moment kind of depression. He did not change anything in my contract and told me to take the breaks I need.
I spoke openly about my misophonia with anyone I had to share working spaces with.  I also spoke with my direct supervisor about some emotional needs I had periodically, but only after we had developed a trusting working relationship.

Explained to my boss that I had to pause in the middle of a late night deployment because I was physically ill with worry that the deploy was going to break in a spectactular manner and I wouldn't be able to quickly fix it. I had no idea at the time that this is anxiety. I'm sure my boss knew.

i was diagnosed with a boreout. and when i told my empolyer he was very understandable and helpful. we figured out a plan which was good for both
I discussed being burned-out.

Their reaction was not very supportive, I was once told I should not get myself sick because of work (I associate this for a form of survivor bias).
Talked about depression and counselling, and that I needed time off for that. That was not a problem for either of my previous employers.

Brief mentions that I have ADHD. Occasionally I thought I picked up on a sense that I was using that as an excuse, but if that attitude was actually present nobody ever said it explicitly.

I was struggling mightily, pre-diagnosis. I was encouraged by my employer to seek treatment, and provided generous resources for doing so. 
Disclosed my ADHD
Forced to talk to them about it as I had to occasionally be out. Implemented FMLA. Forced to speak more about it as I had to take an extended leave that then resulted in leaving/losing my job,
I had a mental health break down while I was working at my previous employer (food and beverage). I told them I was quitting and instead said I could take the time I needed and come back when I was ready.

When first entering treatment for my eating disorder I told my boss that I was taking the day off for a medical intake. She asked what kind of intake.

I wasn't really comfortable talking about it with her, but told her anyway because I was worried it would look badly to not share.

She became very awkward and stiff.

I had told my soon to be engineering manager that I had a lot of anxiety and had been stressing myself out to the point of not being able to produce anything anymore. He encouraged me to relax and take time off. This was before I started therapy, so it seemed to be a one off thing for them, even though I knew it wasn't the first tim.e

I revealed that I was having daily panic attacks on the way to work and having a difficult time coming in. They were not very understanding. Henceforth, I've never mentioned mental health issues specifically when needing time off for it.
I explained to my supervisor that I have severe depression, and she thanked me for telling her. There was no other action taken regarding the matter. It was not ever discussed with me again.

After the death of my ex husband and father of my child, I said that I was finding it difficult to deal with pressures at home and at work and feel in control of my work. He was surprised at the admittance and agreed that he felt that I was not in control of what I needed to do at work. The upshot was that after a few weeks I was made redundant and given redundancy counselling which also happened to help with dealing with the bereavement
ADHD was written off as an excuse.
